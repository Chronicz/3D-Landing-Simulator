🛬 3D Landing Simulator

A real-time 3D landing simulator built with openFrameworks (C++), featuring custom spacecraft and environment models created in Autodesk Maya. This project focuses on realistic landing dynamics, smooth rendering, and an extensible architecture for experimenting with physics-based flight control.

✨ Features

🌍 Fully 3D Environment — Rendered using openFrameworks with imported Maya models for terrain, vehicles, and objects.

🛠️ Physics-Driven Landing System — Custom C++ physics including thrust, drag, gravity, rotation, and inertial movement.

🎮 Interactive Controls — Fine-tuned keyboard/mouse inputs for precise maneuvering.

📡 Flight HUD — Real-time indicators for altitude, vertical speed, horizontal velocity, tilt, and thrust power.

☀️ Lighting & Materials — Custom shaders or OF lighting for realistic reflections and depth.

🔧 Modular Codebase — Easily extendable for new vehicles, physics parameters, or environments.

🧰 Tech Stack

openFrameworks (C++)

Autodesk Maya for model creation

GLM for math & transformations

OpenGL (via OF) for rendering

🚀 Goals

Provide a sandbox for understanding landing dynamics

Build an educational, visually clear landing simulation
